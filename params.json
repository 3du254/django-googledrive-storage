{"name":"Django Google Drive Storage","tagline":" Storage implementation for Django that interacts with Google Drive","body":"### How it works\r\n\r\n[Django Google Drive Storage](https://github.com/torre76/django-googledrive-storage) is an implementation of [Django Storage](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/files/storage/) that uses [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) ad backend.\r\n\r\nPlease notice that **with this implementation you could not save or load data from a user's Drive**.  \r\nYou can use only a Drive **dedicated to a Google Project**. This means that:\r\n\r\n* This Storage interacts with Google Drive as a Google Project, not a Google User. \r\n* Your project can use Google Drive only thru [Google Drive SDK](https://developers.google.com/drive/). Because no user is associated with this Drive, **you cannot use Google Drive User Interface**.\r\n* This Storage authenticates with Google using public private keys. See [prerequisites](#Prerequisites) for how to obtain it.\r\n\r\nHaving stated that, with this storage you gain a 25GB space hosted on Google Server where to store your data using Django models.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
