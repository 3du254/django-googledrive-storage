{"name":"Django Google Drive Storage","tagline":" Storage implementation for Django that interacts with Google Drive","body":"### How it works\r\n\r\n[Django Google Drive Storage](https://github.com/torre76/django-googledrive-storage) is an implementation of [Django Storage](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/files/storage/) that uses [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) ad backend.\r\n\r\nPlease notice that **with this implementation you could not save or load data from a user's Drive**. You can use only a Drive **dedicated to a Google Project**. This means that:\r\n\r\n* this Storage interacts with Google Drive as a Google Project, not a Google User. \r\n* your project can use Google Drive only thru [Google Drive SDK](https://developers.google.com/drive/). Because no user is associated with this Drive, **you cannot use Google Drive User Interface**.\r\n* this Storage authenticates with Google using public private keys. See [prerequisites](#Prerequisites) for how to obtain it.\r\n\r\nHaving stated that, with this storage you gain a 25GB space hosted on Google Server where to store your data using Django models.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nTo use this storage, you have to:\r\n\r\n* [set up a project and application in the Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive)\r\n* [obtain the key for your Google Project associated with Google Drive service](https://developers.google.com/drive/web/service-accounts#google_developers_console_project_service_accounts)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nThis storage is hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). It can be easily installed thru _pip_:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install django-googledrive-storage\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\n### Use\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
